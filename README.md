An Android library that provides a set of annotation processors used for generating code for the following **Robopupu APIs**:

* **Robopupu.MVP**: A Model-View-Presenter (MVP) API.
* **Robopupu.Dependency**: A dependency injection/pulling API.
* **Robopupu.FSM**: A simple library for implementing hierachical Finite State Machines that support most of the UML state diagram features, including: entry points, choice points, and history points.
* **Robopupu.Plugin**: A plugin framework that supports dependency injection (DI) and allows decouples communication between components without requiring the components to explicitly register with one another.
* **Robopupu.Feature**: A flow controller type of architectural design pattern for using components that encapsulate navigation and configuration logic for application features.

Robopupu APIs are used for architecting and developing Android applications. To minimize writing of boiler plate code, Robopupu utilises declarative annotations and annotation processors that generates code for using the libraries.
